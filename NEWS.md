incidence 1.2.0 (2017-04-03)
============================

### NEW FEATURES

* new generic *as.incidence*, to create incidence objects from already computed
  incidences. Methods for: matrix, data.frame, numeric vectors

* better processing of input dates, including: automatic conversion from
  characters, issuing errors for factors, and silently converting numeric
  vectors which are essentially integers (issuing a warning otherwise)

* new vignette on
  [*conversions*](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/incidence/articles/conversions.html)
  to and from *incidence* objects

* new tests


### BUG FIXES

* fixed issues caused by variables which changed names in some datasets of the
  *outbreaks* package, used in the documentation

* disabled by default the isoweeks in `incidence`; this part of the code will
  break with changes made in the devel version of *ggplot2*, which is now
  required by *plotly*
  



incidence 1.1.2 (2017-03-24)
==================

### BUG FIXES

* it is now possible to subset an incidence object based on `Date` dates using
  numeric values, which are interpreted as number of intervals since the first
  date (origin = 1)

* NAs are no longer removed from the input dates, as it would cause mismatches
  with grouping factors.




incidence 1.1.1 (2017-02-15)
==================

### BUG FIXES

* adapting to new names of datasets in
  [*outbreaks*](http://repidemicsconsortium.org/outbreaks): `ebola.sim` ->
  `ebola_sim` and `ebola.sim.clean` -> `ebola_sim_clean`



incidence 1.1.0 (2016-12-13)
==================

### NEW FEATURES

* add an argument `iso_week` to incidence.Date() and incidence.POSIXt() to
  support ISO week-based incidence when computing weekly incidence.

* add an argument `labels_iso_week` to plot.incidence() to label x axis tick
  marks with ISO weeks when plotting ISO week-based weekly incidence.


<br>

incidence 1.0.1 (2016-11-23)
==================

### NEW FEATURES

* The README.Rmd / README.md now contains information about various websites for
  *incidence* as well as guidelines for posting questions on the RECON forum.

* incidence now has a dedicated website
  [http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/incidence/](http://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/incidence/)
  generated with *pkgdown*


### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Vignettes titles are now correctly displayed on CRAN (they read '*Vignette title*').
